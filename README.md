## Welcome, I'm Milica 👋
<a href="www.linkedin.com/in/milica-miljkovic-3ba74a158"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white"/></a>

I graduated in 2023 with a degree in Computer Science, which sparked my passion for cybersecurity.  
Since then, I’ve been exploring different areas of security through hands-on labs, research, and continuous learning.  
This GitHub is where I share my projects, cybersecurity lab reports, and scripts as I develop my skills in network security, threat analysis, and ethical hacking.

## Objective

My goal is to strengthen my practical skills in cybersecurity by building and documenting hands-on labs.  
Through this repository, I aim to demonstrate my ability to analyze networks, identify vulnerabilities, and apply security concepts in real-world scenarios.  
This serves both as a learning journal and as a portfolio to showcase my growth as a future cybersecurity professional.
